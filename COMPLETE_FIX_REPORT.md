### **Root Cause Identified** âœ…

- **NOT a code issue** - The database mapping is 100% correct
- **Content Issue**: The actual JPG files contain wrong images
- **Examples from user screenshots**:
  - `product_avocados.jpg` contains cheese image (should be avocados)
  - `product_bagels.jpg` contains garlic/onions image (should be bagels)
  - `product_bell_peppers.jpg` contains eggs image (should be bell peppers)

### **Solution**

## **ðŸŽ¯ Issue 2: Admin Offers Not Showing to Users**

### **Critical Bug Found and Fixed** âœ…

- **Root Cause**: Database `onUpgrade()` method was **dropping all tables including offers**
- **Impact**: Every time app was updated, all admin offers were permanently deleted
- **Timeline**: Admin creates offers â†’ Database upgrade occurs â†’ All offers lost â†’ User sees empty

### **Fix Applied**:

1. **Modified `onUpgrade()` method** to **preserve offers table**
2. **Added comprehensive debugging** to track offer lifecycle
3. **Fixed database connection handling** in OffersFragment
4. **Enhanced logging** in AddSpecialOfferFragment

### **Code Changes Made**:

#### âœ… DatabaseHelper.java

```java
// OLD: Dropped all tables including offers
db.execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS " + TABLE_OFFERS);

// NEW: Preserve offers table during upgrades
// Only recreate tables that need changes
// Offers table preserved with all admin data
```

#### âœ… OffersFragment.java

```java
// Added enhanced debugging for offer loading
// Raw database content logging
// Better database connection management
```

#### âœ… AddSpecialOfferFragment.java

```java
// Added detailed logging for offer creation
// Debug output shows exact values being saved
// Active status switch properly integrated
```

## **ðŸš¨ Image Content Issue Resolution**

The image mismatch is **not solvable through code** - it requires:

- **Replace wrong JPG files** with correct content, OR
- **Rename files** to match their actual content

**Current Status**: Code works perfectly, content needs manual correction.
